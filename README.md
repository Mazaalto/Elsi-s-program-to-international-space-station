# Elsi's program to international space station
 Me and my daughter wanted to something cool related to space after watching Buzz Lightyear movie. After a little bit of googling we found Astro Pi Missions where team can code a project that will be run in the ISS! We build a small program that displays a flower and the flower's background will change according to the astronauts shirt color.
